# FlexKids2015
FlexKids schedule stripper written in C# in 2015. 

This repo is the final state of an application I wrote in 2015 that ran on a Rasbperry pi 2B every 30 minutes. After logging in, the application strippes a work schedule from the website and publishes the shifts in a Google Calendar. Also, after finding new shifts, an email was sent.

After stripping the hardcoded usernames, passwords, fixed urls from code, and anonymizing the test html files i pushed the code in a this new repository.

If it doesn't work, it doesn't work!
